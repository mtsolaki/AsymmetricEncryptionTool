# README #

The project contains the following files:

# main.c #
This file contains the main function of the program and includes the following libraries:
<stdio.h>
<stdlib.h>
<string.h>
<unistd.h>
"rsa.h"
"utils.h"

# rsa.c #
sieve_of_eratosthenis: Produces an array of prime numbers and returns the pointer to that array.

gcd: Calculates the greatest common denominator of two integers and returns the value that computes.

mod_inverse:Calculates the modular inverse of two integers and returns the value that computes.

pow_mod_n:Calculates the result of  "(x^exp) mod n" and returns the value that computes.

rsa_keygen: Produces the private and the public key and stores them in two different files. The function
uses the "sieve_of_eratosthenis", "gcd" and "mod_inverse" functions to produce the keys.

rsa_encrypt: Encrypts an input file using the key tha the user provides, and stores the ciphertext into an 
output file.

rsa_decrypt: Decrypts an input file  using the key tha the user provides, and stores the plaintext into an 
output file.

# utils.c #
Contains printing and proofing functions.

# rsa.h #
Contains the function declarations of the "rsa.c"

# utils.h #
Contains the function declarations of the "utils.c"
